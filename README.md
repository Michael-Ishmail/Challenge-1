# Challenge-1
I have been tasked to refactor the code of this website to bring it more in line with modern day code. My complete list of adjustments are as follows:

1. I replaced multiple <div> tags to symantic tags. This allows the code to be more readable and easier to reference within HTML and CSS.

2. I reorganized the CSS code so it follows the same order as the HTML code. This makes it easier to read and cross reference.

3. I consolidated multiple classes in the HTML file. This allowed me to combine multiple CSS lines of code together to create an easier to read/manage CSS file.

4. I cleaned up the code, allowing it to be more readable and easier to manage in the future.
